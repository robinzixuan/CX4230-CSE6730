## How to clean data?

Ensure `python 3.5+` are installed.

Go to CX4230-CSE6730_Project1 directory.

`cd CX4230-CSE6730_Project1`

Then `cd` into the generated project directory (the directory that called `data`)

`cd data`

To run in clean-data mode, run 
```bash
python data_cleaning.py
```
,  then you should input 2019 as year you need get for data and COBRA-2019-CVS.csv as the data clean target filename.(it will take a while the first time you try to run it).Use `CTRL-C` to stop.


## Development

Go to `src` directory.

See `README.md` in `src` for development details.
